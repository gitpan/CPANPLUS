### 0.01 Release Engineering Plan ###

Code branch time: Friday March 15th 00:00 GMT

Things to do before code branch: (jambe, co-kane, kudra, autrijus)

[j] 1. have Setup.pm to ask for makemakerflags and lib, and ditch {perl}
[j] 2. configure/setup methods that aren't public should indicated with _
[k] 3. check documents for new features
[j] 4. Configure should offer methods for Backend to hand it to user at runtime
[c] 5. clean up Internal's interaction with Shell.pm in interactive mode
[k] 6. compile lib/CPANPLUS/FAQ.pod
[c] 7. full pathname as parameter to install
[a] 8. make sure AutoInstall works on all popular platforms
[a] *. do code branch, smoke testing, and portability testing

The above are sorted by priority. All unfinished features should simply
be omitted from the release branch.

After code branch, there will be a "Showstopping Bugs" file under
//member/autrijus/cpanplus/release/BUGS. It should document only bugs
relevant to the above 1-8, and the bugs that prevents user from basic
(documented) functionality.

Only bugfixes related to the BUGS file are allowed to submit into
the release branch.  

Once the BUG subsection drops to an acceptable number (preferably 0),
Autrijus will announce the RC1 for two more days of field testing, and
the initial release will follow after that.

### TODO ###

- test suite from schwern
- move over the status cache from _make to the module objects
- lean mode to load certain source files on demand
- automated configuration

### DESIRED ###

- write a method to make cpan distributions
  - (generate makefile, make dist, etc)
  - also generate deb/rpm/ppm/ports if possible
- create a lockfile so only one instance can run
  - OR multi-user support
- upload feature to cpan
  - integrate the cpan-upload script
- bug reports on failed make (|test|install) to rt.cpan.org or admin
- add 'tee' support (aka IO::Tee) for shell
  - tied STDERR impossible, isa perlbug
- keep one's own module/library directory
- check host existence periodically
- smoke test for all/many modules on CPAN to see how we stand up

### CAVEAT ###

- sometimes, when following prereqs, the shell will keep asking to
  install the same file, but somehow doesn't.
  - workaround: answer 'yes' the first time, answer 'no' after that,
    and it works.
