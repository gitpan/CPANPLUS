### TODO ###

- test suite that covers other modules, not only backend
- move over the status cache from _make to the module objects
- lean mode to load certain source files on demand
- a CPAN.pm shell+API emulation layer

### DESIRED ###

- write a method to make cpan distributions
  - (generate makefile, make dist, etc)
  - also generate deb/rpm/ppm/ports if possible
- create a lockfile so only one instance can run
  - OR multi-user support
- upload feature to cpan
  - integrate the cpan-upload script
- bug reports on failed make (|test|install) to rt.cpan.org or admin
- add 'tee' support (aka IO::Tee) for shell
  - tied STDERR impossible, isa perlbug (although fixed by autrius in 5.8)
- check host existence periodically
- smoke test for all/many modules on CPAN to see how we stand up
  - (the tool is there, i.e. bin/cpansmoke.)
