=head1 NAME

CPANPLUS::FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions about CPANPLUS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the Frequently Asked Questions list for the CPANPLUS kit.
More accurately, it's a very thin placeholder for where the FAQ will
soon be.

The most up-to-date version of the FAQ can be found at the 
website I<http://cpanplus.sourceforge.net>.  This version of
the FAQ may contain updates between code releases.

=head1 QUESTIONS

=head2 I think I've found a bug in CPANPLUS.  How can I see if it has been reported?

The CPANPLUS bugs mailing list archive is available at
I<http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/18022/>.

Work-arounds to known bugs will probably be available in the most
recent FAQ.

=head2 How can I get CPANPLUS to use my proxy?

CPANPLUS currently only supports proxies with LWP::UserAgent.  You will
need to set your environment variables accordingly.  For example, to
use an ftp proxy:

    $ENV{ftp_proxy} = 'foo.com';

Refer to L<LWP::UserAgent> for more details.

=head2 CPANPLUS reports that it is going to fetch during an initial install, but it hangs for a long time then reports a failure.

In versions before 0.04, CPANPLUS was designed to fetch initial files 
exclusively from ftp.cpan.org on the assumption this site would always 
be available. If CPANPLUS hangs during the initial fetch, it could 
mean that ftp.cpan.org is unavailable. This is only a problem for 
installation, as your own host list will be used once CPANPLUS is 
installed. A work-around is to edit I<Config.pm-orig> in I<lib/CPANPLUS> 
in the CPANPLUS directory. Under the hash key I<_ftp>
there's a key I<urilist>. Near that should be the line 
C<'host' => 'ftp.cpan.org'>. Simply replace this host with another one. 

=head2 I upgraded my version of CPANPLUS and something no longer works the same way

The CPANPLUS interface will only be backwards-compatible with 
itself after version 1.0. This gives us a chance to
correct and expand without being locked to an interface in early 
versions. Two things that have notably changed since
the first version are the configuration and some Backend return values.

=head2 Can CPANPLUS do I<random something>?

If it has to do with installing modules, most likely! Keep in mind that
while the default shell may not be able to do something like "install all
modules in the POE namespace", you can easily make something of the sort,
using L<CPANPLUS::Backend>. 

=head2 Why not make I<some change> to the default shell?

The default shell is designed to be what the developers wanted in a shell.

If it doesn't do what you want, consider writing your own with
L<CPANPLUS::Backend>, and possibly releasing it in the B<CPANPLUS::Shell::*>
namespace. You can also change your default shell to be any other CPANPLUS
shell you have installed. 

=head2 What is the lowest version of Perl CPANPLUS works under?

Reliably under 5.005_03.

=head2 On what platforms has CPANPLUS been tested?

FreeBSD, Linux, Win32 and Cygwin. 

=head2 How much CPANPLUS.pm code comes from CPAN.pm?

None.

=head2 How can I install modules if I'm not root?

Set C<makemakerflags> to something like this:

    LIB=~/perl/lib INSTALLMAN1DIR=~/perl/man/man1 INSTALLMAN3DIR=~/perl/man/man3 

Of course you should replace 'perl' with the appropriate directory.

Also, be sure never to use UNINST=1 in C<makeflags>.

=head2 Can I let different users on my system use CPANPLUS?

Currently, it is not possible to have multiple setup files, so all
users will use the same repository and configuration.

=head2 Can I use a local mirror (such as a CD), but fall back to a public mirror if my files are out of date?

To do this you need to ensure that you have an up-to-date listing
of modules so that if the most recent version of a module isn't
found in the local mirror, CPANPLUS will try to get it from the
external mirror.

In your setup, list only complete mirrors.  This way you will get
a current listing from one of them when you start CPANPLUS.

Next, add your local mirror at runtime so that it becomes the new
first choice.

In this example a CD from another server on the network is added
(leave off the host argument if it is on the local machine):

   my $cb = new CPANPLUS::Backend;
   my $conf = $cb->configure_object;

   $conf->_set_ftp(urilist => [ {
      path   => '/mnt/cdrom',
      scheme => 'file',
      host   => '//server',
   }, @{ $conf->_get_ftp('urilist') } ]);

Thanks to Nick Clark for asking this at the 2002 German Perl Workshop.
