#######################################################################
###
### This is a sample module that you can use as a skeleton to create
### a custom distribution builder/installer.
###
### Every CPANPLUS::Dist::* module must provide a few required
### variables and functions, which are explained more in detail below.
### But as a short overview, you at least need the following variables:
###     @ISA                # inherit from CPANPLUS::Dist
###
### And you need these methods:
###     format_available    # a sanity check to see if we can use this
###                         # module
###     init                # init custom code, create accessors
###     create              # create a distribution
###     install             # install the created distribution
###
### If you want to see more actual code for writing your own
### CPANPLUS::Dist::* module, take a look at the other modules in the
### same class. Especially CPANPLUS::Dist::Ports should be a good
### example.

use strict;

### inherit from CPANPLUS::Dist
use base qw[CPANPLUS::Dist];

### to set up the include paths properly for bundled modules ###
use CPANPLUS::inc;

### for I18N ###
use Locale::Maketext::Simple    Class => 'CPANPLUS', Style => 'gettext';

### for error handling, which gets added to the error stack
### use as: error(loc("Something is wrong: %1", $error));
### or:     msg(loc("FYI: %1 and %2", $foo, $bar), $verbose);
use CPANPLUS::Error;

### common constants ###
use CPANPLUS::Internals::Constants;

### specific constants to this package
#use CPANPLUS::Internals::Constants::Sample;

### verbose errors on param checking ###
use Params::Check qw[check];
local $Params::Check::VERBOSE = 1;

### sub called to see if it is possible to create this type of dist
### on the environment we're running in. should warn about why this
### dist cannot be run on this environment. return true on possible,
### false otherwise.
sub format_available { 1; }

### sub called just after the CPANPLUS::Dist object is created, to
### initialize any custom code you might want to run at creation
### time. At this time you should at least create the 
### accessors you're going to use, like in the example below
sub init {
    my $dist    = shift;
    my $status  = $dist->status;

    ### minimally required accessors are already created for you:
    # qw[created installed uninstalled dist]
    
    ### more accessors as you may desire
    # $status->mk_accessors( qw[foo bar bleh] )

    ### other code here
    # ....

### you will probably need to run 'perl Makefile.PL' or 'perl Build.PL'
### first to get a usable environment.

    ### created the package
    $dist->status->dist( '/path/to/package/you/created' );
