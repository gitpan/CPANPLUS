This is the README file for CPANPLUS, Ameliorated interface to
the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, by Jos Boumans.

Please type "perldoc CPANPLUS" after installation to see the
module usage information. For shell usage, please consult
"perldoc cpanp"; the FAQ is available as "perldoc CPANPLUS::FAQ".

### PLEASE NOTE ###################################################

CPANPLUS will eventually be a full drop-in replacement for CPAN.pm.
However, at this early stage in its life, you should *NOT* expect
it to work just like CPAN.pm.

###################################################################

* Installation

CPANPLUS uses the standard perl module install process:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

* Notes for Windows users

If you are using Microsoft Windows, you'll probably need the 'nmake'
utility before installation. It's available at:

    ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe

Please download the file, save it to your windows directory, and run it
from there; that will create the 'nmake.exe' file needed by CPANPLUS.

* Contact

CPANPLUS has several mailing lists you can write to:

- General suggestions: <cpanplus-info@lists.sourceforge.net>
- Bug reporting:       <cpanplus-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net>
- Development list:    <cpanplus-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>
