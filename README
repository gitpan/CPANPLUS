This is the README file for CPANPLUS, Ameliorated interface to
the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, by Jos Boumans.

Please type "perldoc CPANPLUS" after installation to see the
module usage information. For shell usage, please consult
"perldoc cpanp"; the FAQ is available as "perldoc CPANPLUS::FAQ".

You may also want to read the 'ChangeLog' file, which describes new
features, bugfixes and additional notes for this release.

### PLEASE NOTE ###################################################

CPANPLUS will eventually be a full drop-in replacement for CPAN.pm.
However, at this early stage in its life, you should *NOT* expect
it to work just like CPAN.pm.

###################################################################

* Installation

CPANPLUS uses the standard perl module install process:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

* Notes for Windows users

If you are using Microsoft Windows, you will probably need the 'nmake'
utility before installation. It's available at:

    ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe

If you are connected to the internet, "perl Makefile.PL" is capable
of automatically fetch it, and install into your windows directory;
all you have to do is to answer 'y' to this question:

    Required executable 'nmake' not found. Install it? [Y/n]:

However, if you are not yet online, or wish to install 'nmake' into
another directory, then please download the file manually, save it to
a directory in %PATH (e.g. C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND), then launch the MS-DOS
command line shell, "cd" to that directory, and run "nmake15.exe" from
there; that will create the 'nmake.exe' file needed by CPANPLUS.

You may then resume the installation process above, but replace 'make'
with 'nmake' in the last three lines.

* Notes on CPAN testing

Starting from version 0.03, CPANPLUS offers several features to query and
report module testing results.

For example, typing "cpanp -c DBI" in the command line (or "c DBI" in
the CPANPLUS default shell) will display the test results of latest
DBI package.

The "cpansmoke DBI" command will test (but not install) the DBI package,
and send reports back to testers.cpan.org. If you have set the 'cpantest'
configuration variable to true (see below), "t DBI" in the default shell
will do the same thing for you.

If you wish to report module test results as part of installation process,
please answer "Y" to the 'Report tests results? [y/N]:' question during
the interactive configuration. You can also type "s conf" in the CPANPLUS
Shell to start the configure process, or just enter "s cpantest 1" and
"s save" to save the settings.

Please consult "perldoc cpansmoke", "perldoc cpantest" and CPAN Tester's
Website (http://testers.cpan.org/) for detailed information.
