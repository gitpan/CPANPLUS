Changes for 0.77_03
=====================================================
* Rework the parse_module code; regex is more complex, but also more correct
* Allow for more lenient parsing of module names, when the module name
  and package name do not match
* Extend parse_module documentation to include URI  
* Patch Module.pm->package_name regex to also parse 'perl5.6.1' style packages
* The package_[name, version, extension] subroutines are also reworked
  and use the same regular expression as parse_module does now
* Add 'name' to the list of accessors returned by $mod->accessors (it's
  an alias to ->module)
* 'installsiteman3dir' is a 5.8'ism which causes warnings under 5.6
  so only check it if it is defined
* Add the version number to the install log file name
* Add "rescan" option to $conf->init to re-check your path for valid 
  CPANPLUS::Config::* files
* Warn if you're using the old "PERL5_CPANPLUS_CONFIG" env var to point 
  to specific config files ( rt #23721 )
* Make $conf->save return the file name it saved to
* Apply the suggested patch from Grant Mclean that calls $cb->flush(lib) 
  just before 'make install' is called, so the blib/ dir is no longer at 
  the front of the path. XML::SAX was writing a file dynamically based on 
  @INC.
* address RT #22962 Funky error messages when command-line args are missed:
  the default shell now has increased parsing logic
* The check to see if the 'storable' feature was enabled was faulty. This
  has now been fixed.
* Use the full path to a module's Makefile.PL when installing a module, so 
  we don't pick up another Makefile.PL that happens to be in your @INC path.
* No longer use can_run() to find cpanp-run-perl, as it's not an executable.
  Scan path manually in CPANPLUS::Config.
* Document details() items properly
* Show installed file in the details section
* Fix documentation error for $cb->_home_dir (#rt 23196)
* Log which configs are loaded at startup time; The shell default's banner
  shows you how to view these logs.
* Make /showtips a plugin command
* Extend CPANPLUS::Shell::Default synopsis with --xxx style options
* Move to dummy modules for our tests, rather than bundled real modules.
* All .t files now use t/inc/conf.pl exclusively for changes in the
  PATH/ENV/etc settings. This fix allows CPANPLUS to test cleanly with
  bleadperl (5.9.5)
* Clean up the .cpanplus dir in the dummy-cpanplus directory at the
  start of every test to make sure we're running with a clean cache
* Test fixes for Win32
* Disable IPC::Run on Win32 during 'make test'. IPC::Run gets unhappy 
  about having 'odd' FDs allocated to it under Win32.
* Update bundled modules
* update bundled modules, includes version.pm for the first time
* Add realclean targets for our dummy perl directory


Changes for 0.077_02    Fri Oct 20 15:28:22 CEST 2006
=====================================================
* Implemented selfupdate functionality. You can use
  's selfupdate' from the default shell. This will also
  work for bootstrapping purposes
* Hints to use 'Bundle::CPANPLUS::Dependencies' have
  been removed in favour of 's selfupdate'
* The default shell now shows tips at start up
* Dont throw an error if a core module has the same 
  version as it's duallifed counterpart on CPAN -- 
  we can still install from CPAN
* Update bundled modules
* Remove cpanplus inc dir from @INC once we dispatch to 
  cpanp from cpanp-boxed
* Depend on newer versions of Object::Accessor and IPC::Cmd

Changes for 0.076       Fri Oct 13 14:37:27 CEST 2006
=====================================================
* run external perl commands using cpanp-run-perl to enable
  autoflushing cross-platform, cross-ipc-module.
* separate formats for printing 'conf' and 'program' sections
* Add Module::ThirdParty support [rt #12131], see
  'CPANPLUS::Module' documentation for usage
* add cpantest_mx config option [rt #21346], see 
  'CPANPLUS::Internals::Report' documentation for usage.
* update bundled modules, most notably IPC::Cmd, which should
  improve executing sub-commands significantly.

Changes for 0.075_01    Thu Oct  5 17:08:27 CEST 2006
=====================================================
* Various small fixes to make CPANPLUS work better on Win32
  Most of these fixes are done in the bundled modules or 
  dependencies of CPANPLUS
* update bundled modules from CPAN
* no longer bundle IPC::Run, it's too unreliable
* delete failed requires from %INC in cpanp-boxed
* make sure we use 4-arg substr to avoid warning in default shell
* skip undefined messages to error()/msg()

Changes for 0.074       Fri Sep  8 13:12:37 CEST 2006
=====================================================
*  remove the requires: section in META.yml; CPAN.pm 
   thinks it's authoritive for requirement declarations
   and therefor gets our prereqs wrong.
*  replace CPANPLUS::Dist::Sample with the actual
   functional CPANPLUS::Dist::Base
*  increase the number of digits after the comma displayed
   in version numbers from 4 to 6, so that stringified x.y.z
   versions display properly in the Default shell.
*  add the writing of intsall-logs automatically from the 
   default shell
*  update bundled modules

Changes for 0.073_01    Wed Aug  2 15:40:38 CEST 2006
=====================================================

*   'install Bundle::CPANPLUS::Dependencies' should
    now work properly from cpanp-boxed, even without
    a --force option
*   Up requirements to more recent versions of among
    others Archive::Extract, CPANPLUS::Dist::Build,
    File::Fetch & Module::Load::Conditional.
*   Update bundled modules for cpanp-boxed
*   Don't change versions of bundled modules, this 
    breaks 'use Foo 1.0' statements in our dependencies
    Uptodate check is now done with a new feature in
    Module::Load::Conditional that can check %INC.
*   Rework cpanp-boxed to deal better with bundled
    modules and their uptodateness
*   Move module::pluggable code to runtime rather than 
    compiletime this makes 'require CPANPLUS' not run 
    around the FS looking for config files until they 
    are needed
*   Address #20737 (Failed to Setup CLI Programs with 
    Arguments) where the interactive configuration
    wouldn't let you specify options to CLI programs
*   Address #20640: Always Sent 'pass' Report With 
    'force' => 1. Test reports are now marked as 
    'fail' when they fail, even when 'force' is true.
    *   sent mail to module-build@perl.org with the 
        patch for C::D::Build to have the same behaviour
    
Changes for 0.072       Fri Jun 23 18:17:00 CEST 2006
=====================================================

*   This is a major release of CPANPLUS. It includes
    all the changes from release 0.070_01, including
    the following changes made after the beta was
    released:
*   The POD text of CPANPLUS.pm has been revamped to
    be more of a guide than a technical reference.
*   $module->status is now lazily initialized, lowering
    overall RAM usage and startup time at the cost of
    a runtime penalty. Overall, this improves performance
    significantly.
*   Address #20005: CPANPLUS does not check size of 
    downloaded module this adds code that checks if 
    the downloaded size is equal to the size specified 
    by the checksums file
*   Fix file fetching testing issue on Win32 (#18702)

Changes for 0.070_01    Mon Jun 19 17:23:38 CEST 2006
=====================================================
*   This is a major beta release of CPANPLUS, revamping 
    the configuration mechanism. From now on, CPANPLUS 
    no longer requires a setup to be run at installation
    time and should work 'out of the box' on most 
    systems using a pre-built configuration file.
*   CPANPLUS now supports stacked configuration files:
    *   CPANPLUS::Config is the heuristic config file
        which will always be installed sytemwide.
    *   CPANPLUS::Config::System is the systemwide
        config file which can be installed by an admin
        in your perl installation path. This file will
        be available for everyone and override settings
        from CPANPLUS::Config
    *   CPANPLUS::Config::User is the per-user config
        which can be installed by any user in their
        $HOME/.cpanplus directory. This file will be
        available for the user only and override settings 
        from CPANPLUS::Config and CPANPLUS::Config::System
    *   $HOME/.cpanplus/lib gets added automatically to your
        config search path.
    *   All configuration types can be created and saved
        via the interactive Setup. You can invoke it from
        the default shell as follows:
        
        CPAN Terminal> s conf user      # per user config
        CPAN Terminal> s conf system    # system wide config
        
        or during installation time like this:
        
        $ perl Makefile.PL --setup  
*   Makefile.PL has been stripped from all it's magic    
*   Setup is now menu based for a better user experience.    
*   make loading plugin configs work, with priority 
    for system & user configs before the rest
*   address #19438: Key 'file' is of invalid type
    Turns out it's a bug in Module::Build, reported as 
    #19741, which creates a 'Build' file when running
    'perl Makefile.PL' on a M::B generated Makefile.PL
    Add a patch that detects this situation and informs 
    the user
*   Demand Test::Harness 2.62 to be installed due to 
    bug #19505 in earlier versions
*   IPC::Run is now required for Win32 & Cygwin
*   use $Config{path_ext} instead of hardcoded ':' to 
    seperate $PATH in cpanp-boxed
*   Small test changes in 20.t to make sure no test output
    counter mismatches occur.
*   remove all 'clever' code from CPANPLUS::inc, as the
    new config methodology makes it obsolete. Basic 
    functionality is retained only for backwards compat.
*   remove CPANPLUS config version checks back and forth 
    -- should work without from now on
*   make cpanp-boxed work from others dirs than just bin/..
*   make use of package::constants
*   Make sure Bundle-Foo.tgz also gets recognized as bundle
*   Data::Dumper indenting style set to '1' in default shell
*   make constants for libdir etc accept a list, not just 
    a single param
*   address #19738: bogus entry in @INC
*   address: #18270: cpan2dist --archive breaks with 
    relative path    
*   address #18121: invalid value for 'checksum_value'
    which showed that old .stored files can mess up CPANPLUS
    untill they are rebuilt. From now on, Makefile.PL will
    delete old .stored files when installing a new version
*   mark all the versions of inc/ modules as -1, so we
    are always 'not uptodate' when asked to install them
*   remove old api that lets you set values in configure 
    object via backend->new or configure->new, which was
    impractical and unused.
*   updated our bugreporting address to point at the
    rt.cpan.org queue.
*   Clean up source tree from obsolete files
*   Have 'make clean' clean up all the generated files

     

    

Changes for 0.061       Wed Mar 15 16:09:03 CET 2006
=====================================================

*   The template for the original configuration got shipped
    with a few default values that will not work on every
    system. Anyone who manually configures should not be
    affected, but the automated configuration may draw
    the wrong conclusion.
    For safetey sake, and to minimize possible issues for
    users, this release ships a template with sensible
    cross-platform defaults again

Changes for 0.060       Fri Mar 10 17:19:06 CET 2006
=====================================================

*   This is a major release of CPANPLUS, supporting
    3rd party package creation and shell plugins
*   include bin/cpanp-boxed for a bootstrapped version of cpanp;
    this allows you to use cpanp without configuring/installing
    anything.
*   Include clear installation instructions in the README, beyond
    the simple 'perl Makefile.PL; make; make install'
*   save sources to disk after creating the trees, not at end of script
    this should speed up closing the application, at a one time overhead
    when parsing the sourcefiles
*   add more diagnostics on updating source files    
*   Make CPANPLUS::inc redundant -- bundled modules required for boot
    strapping no longer get installed.
*   Update bundled modules for bootstrapping to most recent versions
*   Various tweaks to Makefile.PL to make installing friendlier
*   perl Makefile.PL AUTOINSTALL=1 now no longer requires any user 
    input (just like $ENV{PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT} already did).
*   Filter out .meta files from the CHECKSUMS file
*   apply patch from yperl@club-internet.fr to stop Makefile.PL
    from dying if user doesn't want to configure now, and doesn't
    have an existing config.pm
*   fix typo introduced in 0.052 that broke Classic.pm
*   fix cpan2dist's ungraceful dying if the dist object was undefined
    (fixes part of [#17568] bad diagnostics from checksum errors/cpan2dist)
*   address #17655: [WISHLIST] Report bad signature send out a fail test 
    report when a signature check fails
*   address #17984: (Two Problems in Makefile.PL)

Changes for 0.059_01    Sat Oct 15 14:20:16 CEST 2005
=====================================================

*   This is a development release supporting 3rd party
    package creation and shell plugins
*   Add new callback to filter prereqs 
*   Add plugin support to the default shell
*   Add a howto on writing plugins: 
    CPANPLUS::Shell::Default::Plugins::HOWTO
*   Set Data::Dumper::Indent to 1 in the default shell
*   Document --update_source switch in the default shell
*   Add 's mirrors' to the default shell documentation
*   Improve Internals.pm documentation
*   Add basic documentation to undocumented functions
    in Utils.pm
*   Implement proper 'ignore' option for cpan2dist and 
    rename old 'ignore' to 'ban'
*   Allow the --*list options to cpan2dist to be given
    more than once.
*   Fix typo in cpan2dist that wasn't setting the makefile
    preference correctly
*   Add an option to redirect output to cpan2dist
*   Add alarm functionality to cpan2dist
*   The 'sudo' setting is now being defaulted to its
    previous setting during setup
*   Attempt to show what previous config was found during
    setup if possible.
*   Disable checksums fetch when downloading readme
*   Store found prereqs in the dist object when we can
*   Use constants for strings where possible.
*   Determine installer type in CPANPLUS::Module::dist()
    if we haven't already
*   Support both cp_error/error and cp_msg/msg as 
    diagnostic functions
*   When extracting files, make sure +x is set on directories
*   When extracting files, store their names
*   Renamed vcmp() to _vcmp() to mark it's privateness.
*   Add a seperate method in Dist.pm to check if a prereq
    has been satisfied, so modules subclassing Dist.pm may
    override it (thanks to Ken Williams).
*   Add an 'add_to_includepath' method to Module.pm, so
    modules can add their build paths to @INC.
*   Module::Build's 'perl version too low' diagnostic changed
    between releases. Make sure our test reporter understands
    both (fixes [#15197], thanks to Barbie)
*   t/01_CPANPLUS-Configure.t doesn't load CPANPLUS::Config
    directly anymore, as there may be an %ENV setting
*   Fix t/05_CPANPLUS-Internals-Fetch.t to compensate
    when being on non-unixy platforms [#1455]
    pointing to the config file instead
*   Update bundled modules to their latest version    


Changes for 0.0561      Sat Aug 20 19:57:15 CEST 2005
=====================================================

*   This release holds no functional changes over 0.056
*   The META.yml did not get included in this distribution,
    meaning the PAUSE indexer indexed our include modules as
    well. 
    

Changes for 0.056       Sat Aug 20 13:31:17 CEST 2005
=====================================================

*   This release is identical to 0.056_01 but no longer
    marked as 'development release'.

Changes for 0.056_01    Thu Aug 18 16:26:52 CEST 2005
=====================================================

*   This is a development release testing the splitting
    off of CPANPLUS::Dist::Buid into it's own package.
*   CPANPLUS::Dist::Deb got branched into it's own package
*   Make 'i URI' work from the default shell, enabling commands
    like 'i http://example.com/module.tgz'. parse_module() 
    understands this as well (for API users) -- #11479
*   Add test cases for lack of CPANPLUS::Dist::Deb
*   Add new test tarballs that provide the simples possible
    distributions
*   Add prereq to CPANPLUS::Dist::Deb if the user prefers
    to use Build.PL over Makefile.PL
*   Add a depencendency on Win32::Process on Win32 (bundled
    with AS perl, needed by IPC::Run)
*   Quell warnings about empty prerequisite lists (#13111)
*   Quell warnings about beta-versions being non-numeric (#14106)
*   Platform dependant modules were /always/ getting an NA grade
    regardless whether they failed or not (#13224)
*   Config keys are now sorted when printed in the default shell
    (as requested by Tux)
*   Extracted files now only get +w for the owner, not '755',
    as this interferes with some modules test suite ([#13358])
*   Some modules uses module_name_version.ext rather than the
    usual module-name-version.ext. CPANPLUS now parses both
    correctly (#13367)
*   's mirrors' in the default shell now lists your mirrors.
    To alter them you must still edit the config using 's edit'
*   Buffers are now autoflushed while invoking 'perl Makefile.PL';
    Modules that asked questions during interactive install 
    sometimes had their output held back in the buffer. Since not
    all modules do $|++ in their Makefile.PL, we do it for them
    (#12121)
*   The diagnostic reporting functions 'msg' and 'error' from
    CPANPLUS::Error got renamed to 'cp_msg' and 'cp_error'
    respectively, to avoid conflicts with Log::Message::Simple.
    (This only affects API developers).
*   All bundled modules are updated to their most recent version.    
    

Changes for 0.055       Sat Jun  4 15:53:37 CEST 2005
=====================================================

*   This release just affects users of the Test::Reporter
    and 'cpantest' utilities.
*   The 'munge_test_report' callback was getting the 
    grade passed as of 0.054, but the default callback
    was now returning the wrong item. [#13086]

Changes for 0.054       Fri Jun  3 17:44:40 CEST 2005
=====================================================

*   This release paves the way for the CPANPLUS::Dist::*
    plugins, providing a framework from which to 
    automatically create distributions from CPAN packages
*   Redo the 'cpan2dist' commandline tool, adding many
    new options
*   Record all messages from the 'make' command on the
    stack regardless.
*   Use the word 'test' when testing modules, not 'create'
*   Note in test reports that we skipped tests [#11587]
*   Fix some small documentation error [#11570]
*   Double check if a module is uptodate before asking 
    the user -- another prereq may have installed it 
    already [#11840]
*   Do a 'grep unique' on missing prerequisites, so we 
    dont list them more than once, even if the test output 
    does -- fixes bug [#11637]    
*   Make sure we use an empty 'dist_type' in the tests in
    case the user set on in his config
*   Add a _copy function to Utils.pm
*   Make sure the 'force' flag is propagated properly to
    the 'resolve_prereqs' function
*   Add build_prereq flag to indicate prereqs should be 
    built even when uptodate when run under a packagemanager
*   When running CPANPLUS from a path not (absolutely) in 
    your @INC, we add our own path to 'original_inc' which 
    we restore on shell outs
*   Pass the grade to the 'munge_report' handler    
*   Many test report improvements as provided by Barbie 
    in ticket #12302
*   Not all prereqs live on CPAN -- skip noting them as a 
    loaded prereq if we can't find it in the module tree 
    (as reported in #12723)
*   Bundled a version of T::H that does supports the 'no_plan' 
    feature of Test::More (#13019):
    We can't automatically do 'the right thing' as 'make test' 
    invokes 'test_harness' which loads T::H before we can even 
    interfere so we add a msg about too low version to the 
    Makefile.PL instead and fall back to basic tests
*   Tell users why their sudo password might be asked during
    'make test'

Changes for 0.053       Fri Feb 11 10:07:08 CET 2005
====================================================

*   0.052 did not ship with its META.yml, causing a few
    of the bundles modules to be indexed. This release is
    only relevant to the PAUSE indexer, and changes nothing
    on the client side whatsoever.


Changes for 0.052       Wed Feb  9 18:44:13 CET 2005
====================================================

*   Make auto-installation work (with some guess work) if
    $ENV{PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT} is set.
*   Setup decent defaults for the callbacks, so scripts 
    don't have to set them unless they want actual callback
    behaviour (This helps ExtUtils::AutoInstall greatly).
*   chmod() extracted files to 755 so we do not get permission
    denied errors when trying to remove them or copy over them
    if they were not +w for the user.
*   Don't use sudo, even if it's configured, if the user is
    root already.
*   Default to 'prefer binary programs' if Compress::Zlib is
    not installed.
*   Make 'parse_module' deal better with paths that have sub
    directories in them.
*   Make 'parse_module' deal better with version numbers 
    that have letters in them.
*   Don't shell out to get the perl version if the perl we
    looking for is $^X;
*   Improve finding a proper homedir for cpanplus on VMS    
*   Accept the perl version as an optional argument to 
    'module_is_supplied_with_perl_core'
*   Require Test::Reporter 1.27 for test reporting; it fixes
    many bugs.
*   Only load Module::Build when we really needed it, not on
    any installation.
*   Fix a bug that made 's reconfigure' not use the defaults
    from your current config.
*   RedHat 9.0's stock perl has a few serious bugs in it 
    (they applied custom patches) and will break CPANPLUS
    badly. Add a note to the makefile.pl that redhat users
    should upgrade their perl.
*   CPANPLUS::inc was encountering 'use' calls that had windows
    paths rather than unix paths (???). Patch to compensate
    for this.
*   Module::Load::Conditional cache is being flushed in standard
    flush runs now, allowing use of LWP (and similar) when it
    becomes available, even if it previously wasn't.
*   Don't copy 'Config.pm-orig' to 'Config.pm' during Makefile.PL
    stage -- if the user has a custom config and forgets to set
    the environment var, CPANPLUS' tests will use the wrong config.
*   Some tarballs have '.' as directory, rather than project sub
    directory. Guess first for extraction dir and verify, only 
    then try the actual extract path.
*   Improve documentation in the Default shell
*   Improve test reporting texts as supplied by Barbie
*   Add a callback to munge test reports before they are sent
*   Add versions of loaded dependencies to the test reports.
*   Make limited tests on skipped configuration work properly.    
*   Don't use sudo to install into our own sandbox for 
    Module::Build tests
*   Skip module::build tests if we're under PERL_CORE and
    M::B is not available (not yet integrated)
*   Skip install tests if run under PERL_CORE
*   Adjust include paths and paths to perl when tests are
    run under PERL_CORE
*   Update bundled IPC::Run to version 0.80    
*   Update bundled Module::Build to version 0.26081
*   Improve tests    

Changes for 0.051       Fri Jan 14 15:10:02 CET 2005
====================================================

*   First official release in the ground-up rewrite '0.05x'
    series
*   When determining installed versions, don't parse
    commented out versions
*   Version numbers of 'undef' aren't really versions, they
    are now treated as '0.0'
*   Split out 'create' into 'prepare' and 'create' so that 
    package manager plugins can provide an option to alter 
    metadata before actually building the package
*   Add convenience methods for 'prepare' and 'create'    
*   Update CPANPLUS::Dist::Sample docs to reflect new
    prepare functionality
*   Use constants where possible    
*   Add new methods 'contains' to get a list of modules 
    contained in a package
*   Update to bundle Module::Build 0.2607
*   Return to prefering Build.PL over Makefile.PL
*   Update various other bundled modules
*   Bundle Module::Pluggable for Dist:: plugin support
*   Missing test suites of module was not detected 
    properly, resultings in undeserved 'pass' grade
*   dslip data with ';' in it caused parse errors
*   Mark a fatal error when loading the shell and not being
    able to load a valid config file
*   Various spelling fixes
*   Improve tests


Changes for 0.050_04    Sun Dec 26 16:54:46 CET 2004
====================================================

*   Add rsync support to CPANPLUS
*   List rsync mirrors during setup
*   Default to the email mentioned in Config.pm during setup
*   Add timeout support for fetching files from mirrors
*   Config version has gone up because of new timeout version
    -- reconfiguration required
*   Mention Bundle::CPANPLUS::Dependencies in the Makefile.PL    
*   Add license information to dslip output
*   Send N/A Grade to cpantesters when your perl version is
    too low according to the Makefile.PL
*   Drop dependancy on Mail::Send for test reporting, use a 
    fixed version of Test::Reporter instead
*   Alias $modobj->name to $modobj->module for more DWIMery    
*   cpan2dist now allows creation of distributions from local
    tarballs as well
*   cpan2dist now uses the newly defined dist standard to find
    out where distributions were created
*   cpan2dist (and CPANPLUS::Dist) plugin detection is now regex
    based
*   Specifying CPANPLUS object id's when creating fake module 
    or author objects is now optional
*   Small backward-compat hack to make sure old versions of
    ExtUtils::AutoInstall keep working with the new CPANPLUS
*   Various documentation patches
*   Update various bundled modules



Changes for 0.050_03    Fri Dec 17 13:54:48 CET 2004
====================================================

*   Move to Module::Pluggable to find CPANPLUS::Dist::*
    plugins.
*   Make CPANPLUS::Dist::* generate a few required accessors
    itself, rather than making all submodules do it themselves
*   Rename cpan2dist.pl to cpan2dist to be more 'unixish'
*   Improve cpan2dist diagnostics
*   Add pod to cpan2dist
*   Change config layout for distribution types (incompatible
    change -- will require reconfiguration)
*   Add 2-way version checking so cpanplus + its config can
    both verify if their counterparts are compatible
*   Move logic for 'best_path_to_module_build' to Module.pm    
*   Make logic to detect installed modules follow symlinks
    (required for among others, debian)
*   'force install' will try even harder to install a module
    if it can, even if it previously failed.
*   Make test reports report the version of CPANPLUS, not the
    version of the constants file the headers are in.
*   Update various bundled modules to their newest versions
*   Stringify '$@' to avoid clobbering by sub routine calls
*   Various documentation improvements
*   Various spelling fixes
*   Clean up trailing whitespace from sources
*   Add more files to MANIFEST.skip
*   Update MANIFEST


Changes for 0.050_02    Fri Dec 10 15:03:39 CET 2004
====================================================

*   Move CPANPLUS::Dist::(Deb|Ports) to it's own repository
*   Fix error when Test::Reporter is unavaliable
*   Various spelling fixes
*   Added CPANPLUS::Hacking pod with instructions how to hack on
    CPANPLUS
*   Added an environment variable 'PERL5_CPANPLUS_IS_RUNNING' which
    will be set to the current process id, so subprocesses can
    recognize that they are running under CPANPLUS
*   Some wordings have changed for the setup, to make things a bit
    clearer
*   Add 'do we have test::reporter support' probing code (used in
    test suite)
*   Add Mail::Send as a prerequisite for test::reporter support
*   Don't attempt to actually send test reports from our test suite
    -- Test::Reporter doesn't do that itself either, we might have 
    failed tests due to Test::Reporter rather than ourselves
*   Mention 'bundle::cpanplus::test::reporter' which has all the 
    modules needed to have test::reporter support enabled
*   Improved accuracy for core module detection logic and errors
*   More support for connecting to remote machines using 
    CPANPLUS::Daemon (not yet released, but will be soon)
*   Add extra clean up arguments to our own Makefile to remove temp
    files
*   Extensive overhaul of CPANPLUS::Dist::Build to get Module::Build
    support working properly (lots of workarounds for bugs in the M::B
    API -- we now bundle a custom patched M::B (0.26061) to cope)
*   Module::Build now accepts buildflags    
*   Seperate inc path for installers (defacto only Module::Build
    right now)
*   Update various bundled modules like Object::Accessor, IPC::Cmd,
    Archive::Extract.
*   Smarter loading of bundled modules    
*   Various speed optimizations
*   't --force' can send a new test::report now
*   Don't force current installer format onto prereqs, unless it's
    explicitly requested
*   Make the default shell be aware when it's running in noninteractive
    mode, making sure it makes no suggestions with require interactivity
*   Add a message about where the module was extracted to in verbose mode
