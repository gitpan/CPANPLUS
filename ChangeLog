[Changes for 0.03 - April 9, 2002]

This release is dedicated to Elaine -HFB- Ashton, for her tireless
efforts on maintaining search.cpan.org, perl advocacy, and sponsoring
the cpantest/cpansmoke integration support present in this release.

See the "Notes on CPAN testing" section in README for instructions
on how to use the test-related integrations.

* New Shell Commands

 - 'c' checks testing results of modules from testers.cpan.org.

 - 'x' fetches and reloads indices.

 - 'o' searches for installed modules that have a newer version on CPAN.

 - 'u' uninstalls modules.

 - 'r' fetches and displays README files of modules.

 - 't' tests modules without installing them.

* New Features

 - The module/author tree is loaded on demand instead of at startup.

 - CHECKSUM files are fetched only when needed.

 - CHECKSUM file is now parsed instead of eval()'ed to improve security.

 - New 'cpantest' configuration variable. ('Report module build results?')

 - Bundles Kurt Starsinic's 'cpantest' script to report test results.

 - Added the 'cpansmoke' script to help batch-testing CPAN modules.

 - install() and make() now take a 'target' option to control the make target.

 - Failed host will not be retried within the same session.

 - Paged output for README and command listings exceeding screen rows.

 - Better formatting for version numbers (%3.4f instead of %7s).

 - _can_use() now takes a 'complain' option to control display warnings or not.

 - _make() uses IPC::Run and/or IPC::Open3 to capture external command buffers.

 - Dependency probing in Makefile.PL is now enabled by default.

 - Module operation commands in Shell now accepts number ranges (e.g. 1..10).

 - New installed(), reports() and validate() public methods in Backend.pm.

 - Module operation methods in Backend.pm now takes modobj, modname or distname.

 - New pathname() method of Backend returns the canonical distname of a module.

 - Most Backend methods that operates on modules are also Module object methods.

 - The Configuration setup process may be completed automatically now.

 - Properties of Module and Author objects are available as accessor methods.

 - Makefile.PL can automatically fetch and install nmake.exe on Windows.

* Bug fixes (and their first reporters):

 - Setup.pm used to break newer Term::ReadLine versions. (Matt Sergeant)

 - ^D in Default Shell should print "\n" on exit. (Jorrit Waalboer)

 - Archive::Tar was failing on Debian GNU/Linux. (Jorrit Waalboer)

 - _ask_prereq() message may exceed column 80. (Jorrit Waalboer)

 - 'make distclean' used to complain about Config.pm and .pm~. (Jochen Stenzel)

 - Shell should report errors encountered during failed commands. (Mark Fowler)

 - Defaults to cpanplus@example.com, not $Config{cf_email}. (Peter Sergeant)

 - Fixed endless dependency loop on modules not in modtree. (Barrie Slaymaker)

 - More accurate Win32 installation instructions.

 - Various tarball filename parsing failures fixed.

 - Modules belong to the core Perl distribution are never fetched or installed.


[Changes for 0.02 - March 27, 2002]

This is mainly a bugfix release, due to the rather serious issue of not able
to change configuration variables from the default shell.

* New Features

 - Separated Shell::Default's version number from Backend; both are displayed.

* Bug fixes (and their first reporters):

 - Don't let Archive::Tar set uid/gid to prevent local exploit. (Ton Hospel)

 - Scalar configuration variable setting was mistaken as hash in default shell.

 - Documentation fixes in various places.


[Changes for 0.01 - March 26, 2002]
